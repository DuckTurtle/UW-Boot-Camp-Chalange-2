# UW Boot camp Chalange 2 porfolieo website.

## Description
This is the first version of my porfoleo page. I created this as a way for future employers to have all the information the would like about me in one spot. I learned more pratical aplacations of css and also how when css elements mix they don't like to function like they would on their own.

## Installation
There is no installation required. All aplacations should work on opening the website.

## Usage
This website has 4 features. At the top of the page there are 3 quick find links that jump you to diffrent sections of the page. Next you have the About Me section that will increase its fount size when hoverd over. Then in the My work section you have boxes that each contain an place holder for my future projects. Please note none of the curent items are my work, they are just placeholders to show i know how to link my work. Lastly at the botom there are two hyperlinks that direct you to my git hub page and my email.
