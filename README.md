# UW Boot camp Chalange 2 porfolieo website.

## Description
This is the first version of my portfolio page. I created this as a way for future employers to have all the information they would like about me in one spot. I learned more practical applications of css and also how when css elements mix they don't like to function like they would on their own.

## Installation
There is no installation required. All applications should work on opening the website.

## Usage
This website has 4 features. At the top of the page, there are 3 quick-find links that jump you to different sections of the page. Next, you have the About Me section that will increase its font size when hovering over it. Then in the My Work section, you have boxes that each contain a placeholder or a finished project. Please note none of the placeholders are my work, they are just there for formating. Lastly, at the bottom there are two hyperlinks that direct you to my git hub page and my email.
